### Car Color Detection System with GUI

This project is a **Car Color Detection System** built with **Python** using **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **OpenCV** for image and video processing. The system can detect cars and people in images or videos, predict the color of detected cars, and display the total number of cars and people.

#### Key Features:
- **Detect Cars and People:** The system uses a pre-trained object detection model (MobileNet SSD) to detect cars and people.
- **Predict Car Color:** A pre-trained car color detection model is used to predict the color of the detected cars.
- **Zoom Functionality:** You can zoom in and out on the displayed image using the mouse scroll wheel.
- **Video Processing:** The system can process videos, detecting and counting cars and people in real-time.
- **Full-Screen Display:** The GUI runs in full-screen mode, and you can exit using the "Esc" key.

#### How it works:
1. **Open Image/Video:** Load an image or video file using the buttons provided in the GUI.
2. **Detect and Count:** The system detects cars and people, predicts the color of each car, and draws rectangles around them. It also displays the car color names and counts the total number of cars and people.
3. **Zoom in/out:** Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in or out on the image.

#### Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`tensorflow`, `opencv-python`, `Pillow`, `tkinter`).
3. Run the script.
4. Use the buttons to open images or videos for processing.
